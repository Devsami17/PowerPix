                    November 1979 was when the Jackpot chase began. I was in 
my third year of college at the University of Western Ontario, in 
London, Ontario Canada and had been studying statistics and 
programming for 2 years. When I first heard about the Super 
Lottario, one the first online lotteries in Canada, I was intrigued. 
How hard could it be to predict a Jackpot? How little I knew 
then – lol. I remember doing a hand calculation on the top 
numbers for the latest handful of draws and was sure I was 
onto something. My best friend, Bob “Hirsty” Hirst and I 
marched off to the local convenience store to buy a handful of 
tickets. I don’t recall how many we purchased, remember we 
were students at the time, but we had high expectations. To 
say the least we didn’t win the Jackpot, but the passion was 
ignited.
                 </p>
          
          <p>
            Fast forward to 2003. I had been toying with theories and 
models for Lotto 649 for over 20 years at this time, using 
spreadsheets. I had taken a package at the end of 2002 and 
had some time to decompress and plan my next career. What a 
perfect time to buy a bunch of computing power and get to 
work on cracking the code of Lotto 649! In early spring of
2003, I had developed enough of a model that I shared the 
results with my future business partner Peter Rose. That lunch 
was memorable. So much so, we decided to start a company to 
market these “enhanced” predictions to the general public. 
From 2003 to 2012, Winners Edge Information Services (WEIS) 
tracked 257 lotteries across the U.S. and Canada, providing our
members with some great picks. We “predicted” about 550 
jackpots including some for Powerball and Mega Millions, but 
we never had enough members to box all of the numbers in 
order to produce a actual Jackpot winner. We had a notary
audit out predictions and still have the documentation today of 
a Powerball Jackpot we predicted within five (5) draws of 
getting our “Jackpot Alert” signals from our model.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it was then, it is today. To have someone win a Jackpot, you 
require enough members to box all of the combinations. I 
recently reached out to DraftKings with a proposal for them to 
offer our predictions to their top players as a benefit of 
membership. DraftKings reported that they had over 3.1 
million MUPs (Monthly Unique Players) in Q2 of 2024. To box 
every combination of our top ten (10) models, we need to box 
3,769,920 combinations. It’s not a requirement, but it’s a lock 
when you know every combination had been played. If each 
player plays 5 tickets, this comes out to roughly 750,000 players
which is a fraction of their 3.1 Million MUPs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m still pursuing DraftKings and other betting platforms to see if 
they would like to offer our picks to their members, but in the 
meantime, <strong>we’ve decided to offer them to the public FOR 
    FREE!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s right you can play Powerball using 3.7 Million 
combinations instead of 292 Million. In 2024, Powerball has 
had eight (8) Jackpot winners to date, Power Pix has correctly 
predicted three (3) Jackpot winners using 288 Million fewer 
combinations! More importantly, since 2018 we have 
corrected predicted over 450, 5 of 5 winning tickets, a period of 
just over 900 draws. We average a $1 Million, 5 of 5 ticket, 
every two (2) draws, or six(6) a month, or about 75 per year. 
Annually, 1 in 10,000 of our 750,000 members is likely to 
become a Millionaire if they play all 156 draws in a given year! 
The odds of hitting a 5 of 5 ticket on your own playing 
Powerball Is almost in in 12 million
          </p>
          <p><strong>Which odds would you rather have 1 in 10,000 or 1 in 12 
            million?</strong></p>
            <p>
                How can we afford to offer this service at no cost? I’m 
comfortable, but I’m not independently wealthy. For U.S. 
players who can purchase their tickets in person or online, we 
definitely recommend using this approach. For our 
international players, we are affiliated with an online service, 
that pays us a commission on ticket purchases which they make 
on behalf of their members.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope this has given you an insight into my history and the 
reason for creating this site. Please play responsibly. If $10 per 
draw is too much for you, don’t do it. If you can join a group or 
create a group of players to make this an affordable and fun 
experience, then consider trying our recommendations.
